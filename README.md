Project to automate work related activities

This is a juptyer notebook with code which can be used to automate the following tasks:
- Import images from a directory
- Resize the images and extract the desired corresponding width or height
- Extract the 'orientation'
- Given a number n, extract n colors from each image and classify it based on the created color dictionary
- Export all these information in a csv or xmls file to be used later
